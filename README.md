# Solar Panel Controller

## Purpose:
This system is built to control a solar panel equipped with a linear actuator to control the angle of the panel and a DC motor to rotate the panel.
With both of these, paired with an anemometer and a GPS, this system can track the sun accurately to absorb the maximum amount of sunlight possible.
Along with this, the system is also able to handle high wind speeds by use of an anemometer.
